We are actively working on the book and aim to complete the first draft by the end of 2021. Meanwhile, we are sharing drafts of individual chapters for early feedback and comments. Please do so by openning an github issue, if possible, so that we have everything in one place. Thanks in advance! ðŸŒ»
